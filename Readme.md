This code implements a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) to generate images of handwritten digits (MNIST). It trains a generator and a discriminator in competition, with visualization of results and saving of models. The generator transforms random noise into images, while the discriminator learns to distinguish true images from false ones, with a typical adversarial loop (min-max).
